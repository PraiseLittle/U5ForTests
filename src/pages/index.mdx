# STM Cube

<YouTube youTubeId="0OjPY-3qMNU"/>

*STMCube is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease developers life by reducing development efforts, time and cost.*

STM32Cube covers STM32 portfolio.

STM32Cube Version 1.x includes:

* The STM32CubeMX, a graphical software configuration tool that allows to generate C initialization code using graphical wizards.
* A comprehensive embedded software platform, delivered per series (such as STM32CubeU5 for STM32U5 series)

  * The STM32Cube HAL, an STM32 abstraction layer embedded software, ensuring maximized portability across STM32 portfolio
  * A consistent set of middleware libraries such as ThreadX, FileX, USBX, NetDuoX, OpenBootloader, USBPD, trustedfirmware, mbed-crypto, Network Library…
  * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.
  * A new LPBAM (Low Power Background Autonomous Mode) utility which is a software helper that assists STM32U5 users in the elaboration of LPBAM scenarios.

The STM32Cube firmware solution offers a straightforward API with a modular architecture, making it simple to fine tune custom applications and scalable to fit most requirements.
Both the HAL and LL APIs are production–ready, checked with CodeSonar® static analysis tool, and developed in compliance with MISRA C® guidelines, following a process certified according to IEC 61508 systematic capability 2 level (SC2). Reports are available on demand.
